            <h2>Ofcourse you wanna be able to use hyperlinks in your website. This can be used to open new websites or to redirect the viewer to a different part of the site.</h2>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePZckW651bQ"> One of my favourite videos on the interweb :)</a>
            <p>As you can see the video above annoyingly redirects you to youtube via the same tab. <br />
                It can be nicer for people to have it automatically open in a new tab, this is done in the link below by typing: target="blank".
            </p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePZckW651bQ" target="blank"> Still one of my favourite videos on the interweb :)</a>
            <p>You can also make links that make a user download something. By writing download="..." you can give the downloaded file a name for the downloader.</p>
            <a href="Bojji.jpg" download="Happy Bojji" target="_blank"> Bojji!</a>

            <p>More times then not you want to actually show an image on the page of your website, instead of having someone download it. <br />
                This is very similair to the previous things we learned.
                But this time we use &lt;img&gt; instead of &lt;a&gt;. And now we replace href="..." with src="...". <br />
                If we do that, we can show any memes we want directly on the website.
            </p>
            <img src="Bojji.jpg" title="MemÃ©"></img>
            <p>By writing title="..." i have made is so that when you hover your mouse over the image, some text will be shown.

            <h2>LETS LEARN LISTS</h2>
            <p>We have three types of lists at our disposal. Lets start with the most basic one: unordered lists.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>With this type of list</li>
                <li>we can make </li>
                <li>very simple lists</li>
                <li>like this</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Why the fuck are the dots so far to the left.</p>
            <ul >
                <li>With this type of list</li>
                <li>we can make </li>
                <li>very simple lists</li>
                <li>like this</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'll fix it later. NEXT UP: ORDERED LISTS. They are pretty much the same, but this time it is ordered with numbers. <br />
                its gonna fucking go all the way left again, i can feel it
            </p>
            <ol >
                <li>With this type of list</li>
                <li>we can make </li>
                <li>ordered lists</li>
                <li>like this</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I fucking knew it but cant be bothered to fix it right now. NEEEXT: some weird ass list. idk what its called but here it is.
            </p>
            <ol >
                <dt>With this type of list</dt>
                <dd>we can make </dd>
                <dt>these weird lists</dt>
                <dd>which you can split up into more lists</dd>
                <dt>I dont like it</dt>
                <dd>so im not gonna use it, its just weird</dd>
                <dt>Why is all my text in the middle of the screen? Maybe I should have started in an html only environment? Meh</dt>
            </ol>

            <h2>Here we have some button magic (with Javascript). Made by Siavash Kazemsade - 18/12/2021</h2>
            <button onClick={increaseNumber}>go to 5</button>
            <button onClick={increaseNumberLambda}>go to 10</button>
            <button onClick={() => { setNumber(20); }}>go to 20</button>
            <h5>{number}</h5>

            <hr />

            <h2>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>

            <p>I am starting to get bored of html so lets just start to use CSS. It's the next step to frontend development before javascript. <br />

                It doesnt look that difficult so lets start making random shit to practice. <br />
                <br />
                (btw cascade apparently means this:
                a process whereby something, typically information or knowledge, is successively passed on.)
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2 className="colorbg" style={{ color: "blue" }}>COLORS</h2>

            <p className="colorbg">This black and white shit is starting to really bore me so imma just starting adding random ass colors to shit. <br />
                This can easily be done with the help of CSS (totally didnt spent 50 minutes trying to import css into my code) <br />
                When changing the background color you use background-color:"..." and to change the color of the text itself you use color="...".
            </p>



            <div className="colorbg bold">
                <h2 >BOOM (also made the following text bold)</h2>

                <p>If we want to change the white spaces between texts we will have to use divs. <br />
                    and put the css properties in the div tags. (div stands for division, implying that you use it to divide your code into pieces)
                </p>

                <p>Then the spaces in between also have the properties.</p>
                <p >We can also do things like changing the font of your texts. The one im using right now is called sans-serif.<br />
                    To add this i just typed {'style={{ fontFamily: "sans-serif" }}'} in the p tag of my html code.<br />
                    -----All of this is also getting hard to explain by typing. So if you wanna learn all of this.--
                    I would recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyuzt1Dp8X8" target="blank">brocode</a>-----
                </p>

                <div className="colorPurple bold" >

                    <h2 style={{ color: "yellow" }}>BORDERS AN SHIT</h2>

                    <p className="borders" style={{ color: "cyan" }}>so to make shit look nice we need padding and stuff. You just add a lot of stuff around shit to make stuff go to where you want it to go. <br />
                        later we can do this a lot better with bootstrap and react or something apparently. Right now im also making the borders visible, so its easier to see whats happening.
                        <br /> They are always here, but normally not visible. The blue part is from the text itself, the red is called padding and the purple is called margin.
                        <br /> You can adjust the sizes of these by just changing the amount of pixels they should be.
                    </p>
                    <p style={{ color: "purple" }}>
                        boo, i had to add this so i could show the margin border a bit better. Because you cant actually color the margin in CSS (and then I made this text purple to hide it lmao)
                    </p>

                </div>

                <img src="Scenario for CSS padding properties.png" height={400} />

                <hr />

                <h2>BACKGROUNDS GO BRRR</h2>

                <p>
                    apparently you can add images as backgrounds. so lets do that beacuse why not
                    <div className="backgroundProf">
                        <p>
                            i searched on google: professional image and got this. looks good (no gae) <br />
                            i couldnt get the image to show itself fully so imma do it by just typing until the image is fully on screen.
